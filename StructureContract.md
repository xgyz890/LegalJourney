## Structure of An English Contract

A contract has four parts: title, premeable, the body and the tail.

### Title

A title marks the nature of a contract. For instance:
- Sub-Contract
- Service Procurement Agreement
- Loan Agreement
- Confidentiality Agreement
- Petroleum Contract
- Purchase Agreement
- Purchase Order
- Master Service Agreement
- Shareholder's Agreement
- License Agreement
- Construction Agreement

### Premeable

The premeable is usually a brief part before the body to concisely introduce the background of the contract's people, events, things, places, and time. 

This allows readers to gain a basic understanding and get mentally prepared before delving into the complex and lengthy main text of the contract.

The preface generally consists of the following two paragraphs:

(1) The parties involved (Parties), which is the commencement of the contract. It primarily details the names or titles of the parties, their nationalities (citizenship), passport numbers (passport No.), identity card numbers (ID No.) or places of registration (registered residence) and domicile or principal place of business, and the date of agreement (date). 

This part includes the respective abbreviations used in the contract, such as Party A (hereinafter referred to as “Part A”).


>This Agreement is made and entered into this <u>　 　</u> day of <u>　 　</u> in the year of <u>　 　</u> by and between <u>　 　</u>, a company duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of <u>　 　</u>, with its principal place of business at <u>　 　</u> (hereinafter referred to as “<u>　 　</u>”), and <u>　 　</u>, a company duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of <u>　 　</u>, with its principal place of business at <u>　 　</u> (hereinafter referred to as “<u>　 　</u>”)`

(2) The 'Whereas' clause, also known as the 'Statement Part,' 'Explanatory Clause,' or 'Narrative Section,' is named for its use of multiple parallel sentences often beginning with 'Whereas.'

This clause consists of declarative statements made by both parties about their purposes, hopes, and intentions regarding the contract. For instance, it may include explanations by the supplier about their professional background, the legality of the transaction, and practical experience; or explanations by the recipient about their requirements and objectives for the subject matter of the contract.

>WITNESSETH
>
>Whereas Party A possesses proprietary technical information including designs, techniques, workmanship, formulas, skills and other data useful in the manufacture and marketing of certain products; and whereas Party B desires to acquire the right and licence to use the above-mentioned technical assistance for the purpose of manufacturing, using and selling such products; and whereas Party B desires to use the following trademarks owned by Party A. Now Therefore, the parties hereto do hereby agree on the contents of the agreement as follows:

### The body

The main body of a contract is its most essential component, directly related to the rights and obligations of the parties involved. 

Due to its significance, it is also the longest part of the contract. In English contracts, the main body typically comprises two types of clauses: **(1) General Provisions** and **(2) Special Provisions**.

**(1) General Provisions** refer to clauses commonly used in all business contracts, such as provisions for the competent court, settlement of disputes, governing law, definitions and interpretations, validity of the contract, assignment and delegation, warranties, defaults, and so on.

**(2) Special Provisions**, on the other hand, are clauses that appear only in specific contracts. 

For example, a non-compete clause might be included in an employment contract, but not in a share transfer agreement. In fact, the special provisions of each contract vary depending on the nature of the contract, and even similar special provisions can differ greatly in their presentation. 

Types of special provisions:

1. **Definition Clause**
   Defines specific terms in the contract to ensure unified meaning and avoid ambiguity. Terms are divided into common contract terms and specific terms used within the contract.

2. **Representations and Warranties Clause**
   Involves both parties' statements about basic facts and guarantees their truthfulness. 
   
   Key contents include organization, standing and qualification, capitalization, due authorization, liabilities, status of proprietary assets, title to properties and assets, material contracts and obligations, litigation and arbitration, compliance with laws and governmental consents, compliance with other instruments and agreements, and disclosure.

3. **Conditions Precedent Clause**
   Stipulates prerequisites for each party to perform their obligations.

4. **Limited Liability or Limitation of Liability Clause**
   Sets the upper limit of parties' liabilities under the contract.

5. **Non-disclosure or No Publicity Clause**
   Requires confidentiality regarding the contract and its negotiation, signing, and execution.

6. **Termination Clause**
   Specifies conditions for early termination of the contract.

7. **Headings Clause**
   States that headings are for reference only and do not constitute contract content interpretation or modification.

8. **Term Clause**
   Pertains to the contract's effective date, manner, and validity period.

9. **Waiver Clause**
   States that non-exercise of any right does not imply its waiver.

10. **Amendment or Modification Clause**
   Stipulates whether and how the contract can be amended.

11. **Assignment or Successors and Assignment Clause**
   Specifies contract's transferability and procedures, ensuring full binding effect on assignees.

12. **Notice Clause**
   Defines the method and conditions for information delivery between parties during contract execution.

13. **Governing Law or Applicable Law Clause**
   Pertains to laws applicable for contract interpretation and dispute resolution.

14. **Dispute Resolution Clause**
   Details methods for resolving contract-related disputes.

15. **Severability or Survival of Terms Clause**
   States that invalidity of any contract term does not affect the validity of other terms.

16. **No Other Business Relationship Clause**
   Declares no legal relationship other than the contract.

17. **Force Majeure Clause**
   Defines elements and circumstances of force majeure and handling methods.

18. **Entire Agreement Clause**
   Declares the contract as the final, sole agreement between parties, invalidating all prior agreements.

19. **Execution by Fax Clause**
   Allows for contract signing and effectiveness via fax.

20. **Language Clause**
   Pertains to the language of the contract.

21. **Counterparts Clause**
   About the number of contract copies and the effectiveness of each.

22. **Ambiguities Clause**
   Handles ambiguities between the main contract, annexes, supplementary agreements, and different language versions.

23. **Currency Clause**
   Stipulates the currency type under the contract.

### The tail

The tail part of a business English contract typically consists of three sections: the **Attestation**, **Signature**, and **Addendum**.

**(1) Attestation**

This part is a declaration often seen before the signing of the contract

Example:

>This Agreement, made by ...
>WITNESSES
>WHEREAS..., it is agreed as follows:
>This contract is signed by … as a testimony: Whereas …, it is hereby agreed as follows:

**(2) Signature**
The section where the parties sign the contract. It indicates the signatory's proper authority to sign and includes the date of signing. 

For corporate parties, besides the company seal, a representative’s signature with their title and signing authority is also included.

Example:

>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by duly authorized representatives of both parties on the date and year first written above.
>
>By: Representative: By: Representative:
Title: Position  Title: Position
>
>This agreement is executed by duly authorized representatives on the date mentioned in the preamble, hereby witnessed.`

**(3) Addendum**
Also known as Addendum, Annex, or Exhibit. It supplements the main contract clauses and is not present in every contract. 

The following is an addendum to an employment agreement, elaborating on the responsibilities of a manager employed by the company.

Example:

>THE SCHEDULE ABOVE REFERRED TO
>To manage, maintain, and promote the business of the Company.
>To attend personally during the usual hours of business and to supervise and control the business and to be accessible to customers and employees of the Company.
>To keep the usual books of account.

>Generally to protect the interests of the Company.
